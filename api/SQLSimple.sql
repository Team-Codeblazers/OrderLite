	(17,'Vegan Cheesecake','DIRECTIONS:\n\n1. Add dates to a food processor and blend until small bits remain and it forms into a ball. Remove and set aside.\n\n2. Next add nuts and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend until a loose dough forms - it should stick together when you squeeze a bit between your fingers. If it\'s too dry, add a few more dates through the spout while processing. If too wet, add more almond or walnut meal. Optional: add a pinch of salt to taste.\n\n3. Lightly grease a standard, 12 slot muffin tin. To make removing the cheesecakes easier, cut strips of parchment paper and lay them in the slots. This creates little tabs that makes removing them easier to pop out once frozen.\n\n4. Next scoop in heaping 1 Tbsp amounts of crust and press with fingers. To pack it down, use a small glass or the back of a spoon to compact it and really press it down. I found the bottom of a glass works well. If it sticks, separate the crust and the glass with a small piece of parchment. Set in freezer to firm up.\n\n5. Add all filling ingredients to a blender and mix until very smooth. For the coconut milk, I like to scoop the \"cream\" off the top because it provides a richer texture. But if yours is already all mixed together, just add it in as is.\n\n6. You don\'t need a Vitamix for this recipe, just a quality blender. I mixed mine for 1 minute, then \"liquified\" or \"pureed\" it until silky smooth. If it won\'t come together, add a touch more lemon juice or agave or a splash more coconut milk liquid as the liquid should help it blend better.\n\n7. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. If adding peanut butter, add to the blender and mix until thoroughly combined. If flavoring with blueberry or caramel, wait and swirl on top of plain cheesecakes (optional).\n\n8. Divide filling evenly among the muffin tins. Tap a few times to release any air bubbles, then cover with plastic wrap and freeze until hard - about 4-6 hours.\n\n9. Once set, remove by tugging on the tabs or loosening them with a butter knife. They should pop right out. Add more caramel or top with whipped coconut cream if you desire.

Remove the rice from the heat and remove the lid (the water should no longer be visible). Turn the rice out evenly on a well-greased cookie sheet using a spatula or rice paddle.

Be sure to leave a 3/4-inch strip of nori uncovered on the far side. \n\n4. Place tuna strips and some julienne vegetable, cucumber or avocado along the center of the rice. Be careful not to overfill the nori. Place your fingertips over the fillings to hold them in place. Then, use your thumbs to lift up the edge of the bamboo rolling mat closest to you. Begin rolling the mat away from you, while applying pressure to the fillings to keep the roll firm. Roll the mat over slowly until it covers the rice and the near and far sides of rice join, still leaving the 3/4-inch strip of nori, rice-free, exposed.

Set this bowl aside.\n2.	In a larger mixing bowl, whisk together the egg white and vanilla extract. Pour the almonds into this bowl and stir well to coat. Add your cinnamon mixture to the top of the nuts and toss with spoons to fully coat (too many nuts to do the plastic bag toss---you would have to do batches).\n3.	Put the almonds into the slow cooker and cover. Cook on high for 2 hours, stirring every 20-30 minutes or so to keep the almonds on the side of the crock from getting too crispy.\n4.	When the nuts are all hot and toasty, let them cool fully on a length of foil or parchment paper.
